# LemmingsOS — Architecture Overview

## Purpose

LemmingsOS is a self-hosted runtime for autonomous AI agent hierarchies. It provides
structured lifecycle management, supervision, isolation, and observability for
autonomous agents organized in a four-level hierarchy.

Five pillars guide all architecture decisions:

| Pillar | Constraint |
|---|---|
| Micro-agent architecture | Lemmings do one thing; no super-agents |
| Runtime, not prompts | Lifecycle and supervision, not workflow DAGs |
| Safety by design | All external actions go through typed Tools — no arbitrary code execution |
| True autonomy | Lemmings run for hours/days, retry, and resume after crashes |
| Local-first AI | Ollama and self-hosted models are first-class; cloud APIs are optional |

Level descriptions:

- **World** — Hard isolation boundary. No cross-World communication without explicit Gateway. One per deployment or tenant.
- **City** — One Elixir/OTP node. Multiple Cities can form a World cluster. City joins/leaves a World dynamically.
- **Department** — Named logical group of agents within a City. Defines shared purpose, capabilities, and constraints.
- **Lemming** — Supervised autonomous agent process. Has stable identity, lifecycle, and mailbox.

See ADR 0002 for the rationale behind this model.

## Component Overview

### World Registry (`LemmingsOs.World.Registry`)

* Tracks all active Worlds on the local node.
* Enforces World-scoping: no queries or events cross World boundaries without a Gateway.
* Provides the authoritative list of Cities in each World.

### City Supervisor (`LemmingsOs.City.Supervisor`)

* An OTP `Supervisor` (or `DynamicSupervisor`) managing all Departments within a City.
* Responsible for Department startup, restart, and shutdown.
* Reports health to the World Registry.

### Department Manager (`LemmingsOs.Department.Manager`)

* A `GenServer` managing the Lemming pool within a Department.
* Handles Lemming spawn requests, restarts on crash, and graceful shutdown.
* Enforces Department-level constraints (capacity limits, capability filters).

### Lemming Executor (`LemmingsOs.Lemming.Executor`)

* The leaf-level supervised process that runs agent logic.
* Has a stable identity (UUID) that persists across restarts within a lifecycle.
* Exposes a standard message interface: `dispatch/2`, `status/1`, `stop/1`.
* Agent logic is pluggable via a behaviour: `LemmingsOs.Lemming.Behaviour`.

### Event Bus (`LemmingsOs.Events`)

* Internal pub/sub scoped to a City (not cross-City by default).
* Used for intra-Department coordination and Department-to-Department signalling within
  the same City.
* Topic naming convention: `[world_id, city_id, department_id, event_type]`.

### Telemetry Layer (`LemmingsOs.Telemetry`)

* All hierarchy levels emit `:telemetry` events.
* Standard metadata: `world_id`, `city_id`, `department_id`, `lemming_id`.
* Phoenix.LiveDashboard integration for real-time process monitoring.

## Message Flow

### Inbound: dispatching work to a Lemming

```
User / LiveView
      │
      │  Department.dispatch(dept, task)
      ▼
Department Manager          ← validates task against Department constraints
      │
      │  Lemming.Executor.dispatch(pid, task)
      ▼
Lemming Executor            ← runs agent logic loop
      │
      │  Tool.call(tool_name, args)
      ▼
Tool Module                 ← controlled Elixir module; only permitted actions
      │
      ▼
External system / LLM / DB
```

All external side effects go through Tool modules. A Lemming cannot touch the outside
world except through its declared toolset. This is the primary safety boundary.

### Outbound: Lemming reporting results and events

```
Lemming Executor
      │
      ├─── Lemming.report_result(result)
      │         │
      │         ▼
      │    DB (lemmings table updated, status → :completed)
      │
      └─── EventBus.publish(topic, event)
                │
                ▼
           Department Manager   ← subscribed to Lemming events
                │
                ├── notify other Lemmings in the Department (if needed)
                └── emit telemetry event upward
```

The Event Bus is scoped to the City. Events do not cross City or World boundaries
without explicit routing through a Gateway (not yet implemented).

---

## Failure Model

LemmingsOS treats failure as a normal operating condition, not an exception.
This is the core value proposition of building on Elixir/OTP.

### Lemming crash

```
Lemming Executor crashes (runtime error, timeout, bad LLM response)
      │
      ▼
Department Manager (DynamicSupervisor)
      │  detects :DOWN signal from monitored Lemming
      │
      ├── increments restart count for this Lemming
      ├── checks restart policy (max_restarts, backoff strategy)
      │
      ├── [within policy] restart Lemming with same identity (UUID preserved)
      │         │
      │         └── Lemming.Executor resumes from last persisted checkpoint (if any)
      │
      └── [policy exceeded] mark Lemming status → :failed in DB
                │
                └── emit [:lemmings_os, :lemming, :failed] telemetry event
```

### Department crash

```
Department Manager crashes (unrecoverable state corruption)
      │
      ▼
City Supervisor (Supervisor, :one_for_one)
      │  restarts Department Manager
      │
      ├── Department Manager reinitializes from DB state
      │         (active Lemmings are re-supervised from persisted records)
      │
      └── emit [:lemmings_os, :department, :restarted] telemetry event
```

### City node failure

```
City node goes down (network partition, OS crash, deploy)
      │
      ▼
World Registry (on surviving nodes)
      │  detects node :DOWN via distributed Erlang monitoring
      │
      ├── marks City status → :unreachable in DB
      ├── does NOT automatically migrate Lemmings (operator decision)
      │
      └── emit [:lemmings_os, :city, :unreachable] telemetry event
               │
               └── LiveView dashboard reflects updated City status in real time
```

### Telemetry contract

Every failure path emits a structured telemetry event. All events include hierarchy
metadata so operators can pinpoint exactly where a failure occurred:

```elixir
:telemetry.execute(
  [:lemmings_os, :lemming, :failed],
  %{restart_count: n},
  %{world_id: w, city_id: c, department_id: d, lemming_id: l, reason: reason}
)
```

This makes LemmingsOS observable by default — not just when things go wrong, but
at every state transition across the lifecycle.

## Data Model (High Level)

```
worlds
  id, name, config, inserted_at

cities
  id, world_id, node_name, status, inserted_at

departments
  id, city_id, world_id, name, config, inserted_at

lemmings
  id, department_id, city_id, world_id,
  status, agent_module, config,
  started_at, stopped_at, inserted_at
```

All tables are scoped by `world_id`. Context APIs require explicit World scope.
See ADR 0003 for isolation semantics.

## Operational Model

* `mix setup` bootstraps the database and dependencies.
* `mix phx.server` runs the full runtime locally on `localhost:4000`.
* The Phoenix LiveView UI provides a real-time dashboard of the hierarchy.
* All agent lifecycle events are logged with structured metadata.

---

## Future Work (not yet designed)

* `LemmingsOs.Gateway` — explicit cross-World communication bridge
* Multi-City clustering and City membership protocol
* Agent capability declarations and Department-level enforcement
* Lemming hot-reload and live config updates
